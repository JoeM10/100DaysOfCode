# List Comprehension.--------

# name = "Joseph"
# lettersList = [letter for letter in name]

# Conditional List Comprehension.--------
# newList = [newItem for item in list if test]

# Dictionary Comprehension.--------
# newDict = {newKey:newValue for item in list if test}

# Can be used with a existing dict as well.             v---The .items() is needed for this to work.
# newDict = {newKey:newValue for (key,value) in dict.items() if test}

# print(studentScores)

# passedStudents = {student:score for (student, score) in studentScores.items() if int(score) >= 60}

# # Challenge-------- Add the input into a dict by adding each word and the len of the word as the key:value.
# sentence = input() # What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
# # Write your code below ðŸ‘‡

# result = {word:len(word) for word in sentence.split()}

# print(result)

# # Challenge-------- Take the input of a day and temperature in Celsius and convert the temperature into Fahrenheit.
# #            V------ eval() looks at the format and converts it accordingly.
# weather_c = eval(input()) #{"Monday": 12, "Tuesday": 14, "Wednesday": 15, "Thursday": 14, "Friday": 21, "Saturday": 22, "Sunday": 24}
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
# # Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:
# # F = (C x 1.8) + 32
# weather_f = {day:(temp*1.8)+32 for (day, temp) in weather_c.items()}

# print(weather_f)
